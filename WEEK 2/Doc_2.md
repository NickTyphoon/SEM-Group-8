## User Stories
 - Overall user story
 
   As a player, I want to learn programming through games, so that learning can be more enjoyable and engaging, enhancing motivation and efficiency.
 - Sub-story

   1）As a player, I want my character to be able to collect coins, so that I can increase my score and get rewards (pieces of code).

   2）As a player, I want to collect a suitable number of coins in the game (between 5 and 15 per level), so that the game remains challenging and enjoyable, without being too easy or too difficult.

   3）As a player, I want the game to display a pop-up window with instructions on how to use the collected code blocks after reaching a certain number of them, so that I can learn and understand programming concepts.

   4）As a player, I want to receive feedback after rearranging code snippets, indicating whether they are correct or not, so that I can adjust and learn in a timely manner.

   5）As a player, I want the game to have multiple different platforms to explore, rather than just a single platform, so that it adds variety and enjoyment to the game.

   6）As a player, I want my character to perform basic WASD (left, right, up, down) movements, so that I can control the character's actions and navigate through obstacles smoothly.

   7）As a player, I want my character to have the ability to jump, so that I can better control the character's actions and reach additional platforms.

## High-Fidelity Storyboard

## Defined MVP (Minimum Viable Project): 
 - collect coins (pieces of code)
 - user collects up to 10 coins
 - pop-up appears asking user to arrange code in right order
 - the user is able to reorder the code and is told when correct
 - basic platformer, main floor and 2 additional floors the user cna jump to
 - basic WASD movement (left,right,up,down(gravity))
 - the ability ot jump (to be able to reach teh additional platforms)


## Initial Test Plan

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- |----- | ----- |
| 1 | Finish State | the user can finish a section of code |
| 2| Coin collection| the user is able to collect a coin, adding to their "score"|
|3| Safe Restart| the user is give the option to restart the game and have code snippets and score reset |
|4| Order Code | the user is able to reorder code when 10/10 coins are reached|
|5| Platform interaction| ensure the platforms can be interacted with by the user correctly and theres no phasing problems|
|6|Score Update| make sure the users score is updated when coins are collected|
