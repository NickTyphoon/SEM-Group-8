# Game Research --- 19 games

**_1\. Super Mario & Kirby_**  The gameplay of the two games is similar, the player does not use weapons directly to destroy the enemy, but through other means such as Super Mario by jumping on the enemy to destroy the enemy, Star Kirby by swallowing the enemy to gain the ability of the enemy to destroy other enemies. (Kirby can only swallow one enemy at a time and must not be touched by the enemy when he has not swallowed the enemy or he will die).

**Advantage**

1.Classic, simple gameplay requires no teaching (Suitable for children)

2.There is no need to draw additional pictures of weapons

3.Developers don't need to worry about blood bars, enemies will die after receiving one hit

**Disadvantage**

1.The graphic designer doesn't need to draw weapons, but he does need to draw special abilities that the player gets from swallowing enemies or eating mushrooms (the player's new image). Like the player gets bigger/smaller, can breathe fire…

2.For developers, it may be necessary to design more moves, such as double jump, wall jump, roll, flight, etc

**Some thoughts:** The game style can be low pixel style, reducing the workload of the graphic designer, in addition to most of the free material on the Internet is low pixel.

**_2\. Dead Cells & Hollow Knight_**  Both games are more complex and play like Dark Souls, collecting different weapons to destroy enemies.

**Advantage**

1.In addition to the combat system, the game also adds the elements of collecting and solving puzzles and traps, and the gameplay is diversified.

2.Excellent background music, scenery

3.There's a backstory to the game

4.Set up a small map to facilitate the player to view the terrain

**Disadvantage**

1.Save points are small, requiring the player to have a high level of skill

2.More violent scenes (may not be suitable for children)

3.Graphic designers need to design images of different weapons

4.Game developers need to program more player actions

5.If the player gets a gun or a bow, the game developer may need to Disadvantageider the implementation of long-range weapon attacks

**Some thoughts:** Destroying enemies is not a necessary feature for this project, our users are children, and using weapons to attack enemies may bring some violent elements. If you want to add the ability to destroy enemies, Disadvantageider using Super Mario or Kirby. Or change the game type to a collectible puzzle game, which can block players through some squares, doors or traps to achieve the purpose of increasing the difficulty of the game.

**_3\. The Looter, The Red Selence & Altered Alma_**  These games are not yet available, but some of the gameplay and design can be referenced. These games are set in the present or the future, and they are also designed to eliminate enemies to achieve the goal of clearing the level. But the weapons used were mostly firearms.

**Advantage**

1.The setting of the story is as planned (because of the need to collect code, the game cannot be set in a fantasy and magic world)

2\. Compared to the previously mentioned games that have a new gameplay one of the games, players need to restore the scene power, in order to achieve the purpose of unlocking the map. (Until the power is restored, players can only see a small area of the surrounding scene, and players need to fight in the dark)

3.Some game scenarios may not require jumping, and the developer may not make the player jump feature

**Disadvantage**

1.Developers need to make gun-like weapons

2.There's a violent scene.

**Some thoughts:** Because the project's intended plan required players to collect code to finish the game, game graphic designers needed to Disadvantageider modern, cyberpunk style game-related graphics.
