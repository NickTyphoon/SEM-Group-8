## Retrospective
*_What went wrong?_* 
- Drag and drop code does not work
  Solution: Copy the code in a different environment to determine the issue
- Realised that we can’t add visual assets to MVP  
  Reason: Code is not put together yet \
  Solution: Moved to backlog for next sprint. Will push a project first and then combine code scripts from Rao and Shreya 
- Can’t do testing yet  
  Reason: All members not on the same level of coding. \
  Solution: Moved to backlog for next sprint. Everyone now getting up to speed with coding, so tests can be run in next sprint. 

*_What went right?_*   
- Expanded MVP and personality type descriptions
- Paired programming for start menu
- Created character sprites
- Documented planning through planning poker and Gantt chart
